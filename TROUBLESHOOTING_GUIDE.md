# üîß Meetopia Troubleshooting Guide

## üéØ Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. **"Searching..." Button Stuck**

**Problem**: App shows "Searching..." but never finds a match

**Solution**: 
- ‚úÖ **Fixed!** Added automatic match-finding when socket connects
- The app now properly emits `find-match` events to the server
- Includes retry logic if no match found within 10 seconds

**What was wrong**: Room page wasn't telling the server to look for matches

---

### 2. **"Quality Upgrade Failed, OverconstrainedError"**

**Problem**: Some devices can't handle high-quality video constraints

**Solution**: 
- ‚úÖ **Fixed!** Added progressive quality fallback system
- Now tries 4 quality levels: High ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Basic ‚Üí Minimum
- Universal device compatibility (works on any camera)

**Quality Levels**:
1. **High**: 1280x720@30fps (modern devices)
2. **Medium**: 640x480@20fps (standard devices) 
3. **Basic**: 320x240@15fps (older devices)
4. **Minimum**: Browser defaults (any device)

### 3. **Server Sleeping Issues (Render)**

**Problem**: Backend goes to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity

**Solution**: 
- ‚úÖ **Fixed!** Added keep-alive system
- Server pings itself every 14 minutes
- Only activates on Render production environment

---

### 4. **Different Video Quality Between Users**

**Problem**: One user gets HD, another gets low quality

**This is NORMAL and GOOD!** Here's why:
- **Adaptive Quality**: System matches each device's capabilities
- **Better Connections**: Prevents failed calls due to quality mismatches
- **Universal Access**: Works on phones, tablets, laptops, old devices

**How it works**:
- Good network + modern device = HD quality
- Poor network + old device = Basic quality
- Both users can still connect successfully

### 5. **Vercel Analytics Error 403**

**Problem**: `POST https://meeetopia.vercel.app/_vercel/insights/view 403 (Forbidden)`

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Non-critical** (app works fine)
- This is just Vercel analytics trying to track usage
- Doesn't affect video calling functionality
- Can be ignored or disabled in Vercel dashboard

---

### 6. **Connection Timeout Issues**

**Enhanced Solutions**:
- **Multiple TURN servers**: ExpressTURN + OpenRelay + fallbacks
- **Smart retry logic**: 10 reconnection attempts with exponential backoff
- **Connection pooling**: Server maintains standby connections
- **Network quality detection**: Adapts to user's network conditions

---

### 7. **WebRTC Connection Failures**

**Multi-layered approach**:
1. **8 STUN servers** for NAT traversal
2. **Multiple TURN servers** for relay traffic
3. **Progressive quality fallback** for device compatibility
4. **Automatic reconnection** with 2-minute standby mode
5. **Real-time quality monitoring** and adaptation

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Check Connection Status:
```javascript
// In browser console:
console.log('Socket connected:', socket.connected)
console.log('Connection status:', connectionStatus)
console.log('Network quality:', navigator.connection)
```

### Test Network Quality:
1. Open browser dev tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for these messages:
   - "Starting match search with enhanced parameters"
   - "Socket connected to server with enhanced configuration"
   - "Successfully started [quality] quality stream"

### Force Refresh:
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Clear cache and reload
3. Try incognito/private browsing mode

## üì± Device Compatibility

### ‚úÖ **Fully Supported**:
- Chrome 80+ (all platforms)
- Firefox 75+ (all platforms)
- Safari 14+ (macOS/iOS)
- Edge 80+ (Windows)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited Support**:
- Safari 13 (basic quality only)
- Chrome 70-79 (medium quality max)
- Firefox 60-74 (basic quality only)

### ‚ùå **Not Supported**:

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

1. **Check your network**: Try a different WiFi/mobile network
2. **Try different browser**: Chrome usually works best
3. **Disable VPN**: VPNs can interfere with WebRTC
4. **Check firewall**: Corporate firewalls may block WebRTC
5. **Update browser**: Ensure you're using a recent version

---

## üîß Development Debugging

For developers working on the codebase:

```bash
# Check server logs
npm run dev:server

# Test with verbose logging
LOG_LEVEL=verbose npm start

# Check WebRTC stats in browser
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: true, audio: true})
  .then(stream => console.log('Media access successful'))
  .catch(err => console.error('Media access failed:', err))
```

## üí° Tips for Best Experience

1. **Use wired internet** when possible
2. **Close other video apps** (Zoom, Teams, etc.)
3. **Good lighting** improves video quality
4. **Modern browser** (Chrome/Firefox latest)
5. **Allow camera/mic permissions** when prompted

Subject: New Social App Solving Digital Connection Crisis

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], founder of Meetopia, a new social networking app that just launched on the App Store.

What makes it different: We're video-first. While other apps focus on swiping and texting, we believe authentic connections happen through face-to-face conversations.

Why this matters now:
‚Ä¢ 61% of young adults report feeling lonely (Harvard Study)
‚Ä¢ Video calls increased 2000% during pandemic  
‚Ä¢ Users want authentic connections, not superficial interactions

Would you be interested in an exclusive first look? I'd love to share our story and give you early access.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

### 60-Second Founder Story Script
```
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I built Meetopia because I was tired of superficial digital connections.

We have more ways to connect than ever, but people feel more isolated. Why? Because we've lost the human element.

Text messages can't convey emotion. Profiles can't show personality. But a 5-minute video conversation? That changes everything.

Meetopia brings back authentic human connection through video-first conversations. We've built comprehensive safety features, beautiful interfaces, and smart matching.

After months of development and solving Apple's review challenges, we're finally launching.

Ready to meet your next great conversation? Download Meetopia today."
